# Random_forest_classification
Random forest classification generates a single outcome by combining the output of several decision trees. Its popularity has been spurred by its versatility and ease of use, as it can handle both regression and classification problems.

#Learning Goals
1. Use an example to understand how random forests operate.
2. Recognize the effects of various hyperparameters.
3. Apply them to a scikit-learn classification issue.


Leo Breiman and Adele Cutler created the well-known machine learning technique known as random forest, which combines the results of multiple decision trees to generate a single result. Because of its adaptability and ease of use, it is well-liked for jobs involving both regression and classification.

Its broad appeal is due to its adaptability and ease of use, which allow it to effectively handle problems related to both regression and classification. The method is a useful tool for a variety of machine learning predictive tasks because of its strength in handling complicated datasets and mitigating overfitting.

#Uses for Random Forests
1. Businesses can prevent customers from leaving by anticipating which ones are most likely to churn or quit using a service. One tool that can be used for this is a random forest. For example, a telecom company might employ a random forest model to identify customers who rarely use their phones or who have a history of paying late.
2. Fraud detection: Random forests can identify fraudulent transactions in real-time. For example, a bank may employ a random forest model to find transactions from unusual regions or with very high dollar amounts.
3. Random forests can be used to forecast future stock values. It's important to keep in mind that stock price prediction is a very difficult task and that no model can ever be 100% accurate.
4. Medical diagnosis: These help medical professionals diagnose patients. For example, a doctor could utilize a random forest model to help in cancer detection.
5. image recognition: It can recognize objects in images. For example, a self-driving car might utilize a random forest model to identify pedestrians and other vehicles on the route.

Understanding the operation of the random forest algorithm in machine learning requires first examining the ensemble learning approach. An ensemble is simply a collection of models. As a result, a collection of models is employed to generate predictions rather than just one model.

The ensemble uses two distinct methods: 1. Bagging and 2.Boosting

1. Bagging:
Bagging, also known as Bootstrap Aggregation, serves as the ensemble strategy in the Random Forest method. Bagging involves the following steps:

Subset Selection: Choosing a subset, or random sample, from the entire dataset is the first stage in the bagging process.
Bootstrap Sampling: To create each model, these samples—also known as Bootstrap Samples—are taken from the original data and substituted. This process is known as "row sampling."
Row sampling with replacement is referred to as bootstrapping.
Independent Model Training: Every model is trained independently using the relevant Bootstrap Sample. This training process yields results for each model.

2. Boosting:
   Boosting is one approach that utilizes the concept of ensemble learning. A boosting method, often called a weak learner or base estimator, combines multiple elementary models to generate the final output. To create a model, the procedure entails using progressively weaker models.

The Steps of the Random Forest Algorithm
Step 1: A selection of characteristics and data points are used to build each decision tree in the Random Forest model. In other words, given a data collection of k records, m features and n random records are chosen.
Step 2: A distinct decision tree is constructed for each sample.
Step 3: Every decision tree will generate an output.
Step 4: Regression, classification-based majority voting, or averaging are the methods used to assess the finished result.
